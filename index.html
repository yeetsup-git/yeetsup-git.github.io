        <h3>How did we get here?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, it started on an hp chromebook from 10 years ago. I had nothing to do on it because it was stuck on chromeos 72. one day I randomly started coding a css theme and thought "hey, this would be awesome for a meme website". 
          And then it hit me: the silent thought of "hey, wouldnt it be awesome to have a meme website I could access on any old web browser?" and now we're here.
      </p>
       <h3>Well, how's it going?</h3>
      <p>
        well, it's going pretty good. I've got the website running on an iPhone 3g which is funny as hell:

       <h3>How it's made™ with John Applefucker</h3>
       <p>
         This is literally a copypaste from stuff ive previously written, but here we go..
         it uses the <a href="https://fonts.google.com" title="google fonts this way">google fonts</a> library that way it can load fonts without needing the user to have them installed. 
         <s>It also uses a <a href="https://md-block.verou.me/" title="its called 'md-block'. We stopped using it because it doesnt work on older devices.">live markdown translator</a>for quality-of-life and to edit pages faster</s> I stopped using a live MD translator, as it does not work on older systems. 
         See, my mission is to create a meme site that can be quickly accessed on almost any device with a web browser, new and old. To keep things simple, I'm trying to use code compatible with at least any old windows XP, OS X, iOS 6, and Android 4 system.
         This site was originally developed using the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/text-app" title="You've been banished to the google chrome text app repo">default chromeOS text editor</a>, <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2019/02/stable-channel-update-for-chrome-os.html" title="Get google blogged">ChromeOS 72</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton" title="Look, a dead Linux on chromebooks thing!">Crouton</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Chromebook-11-1101-White-Blue/dp/B00FJXVRM8" title="amazon page for the dead thing">and an HP CB2 chromebook (2013? I think?)</a> with write protect disabled. (chromeos nerds know what I'm talking about).
         I recently migrated over to the github web client and vsc(visual studio) for ubuntu and here we are today. 
           
         I hope you have fun seeing my memes and don't try to hack the source code or I will pull up your ip and dns and pin it to my wall of shame.
